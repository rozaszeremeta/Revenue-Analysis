New MRR: MRR generated by new paying users.
Churned Users: Users who stopped paying.
Churn Rate: Ratio of churned users to paid users from the previous period.
Churned Revenue: Revenue lost from churned users.
Revenue Churn Rate: Ratio of churned revenue to MRR from the previous month.
Expansion MRR: Increase in MRR from users paying more.
Contraction MRR: Decrease in MRR from users paying less.
Customer Lifetime (LT): Average time from first payment to churn.
Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): Total revenue per user over their lifetime.

This dashboard enables detailed monitoring and analysis of revenue metrics, helping product managers make informed decisions.
